# Predictive Model for Sales

The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each
product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.
Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

### Evalution Metric

The model performance will be evaluated on the basis of the prediction of the sales for the test data (test.csv), which contains similar
data-points as train except for the sales to be predicted. At the end, have the actual sales for the test dataset, against which the predictions
will be evaluated. Root Mean Square Error value is used to judge the response.
